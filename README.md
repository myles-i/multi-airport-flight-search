I have always been wanted multi-airport southwest flight search since I often have up to 3 origins/destinations for a total of 9 combinations. Super annoying with southwest! Apparently people have tried to scrape the southwest results off of their website to aggregate the results and have been asked to take their site down.

As a side project, I created little website that is the simplest way to reduce this hassle. It lets you input list of airports, and opens a southwest.com results for each combination of airports, and a single google flights tab for aggregated results, excluding southwest. So for 2 origins and 3 destinations, you get 7 tabs. Check it out!
